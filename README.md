# An Ensemble Model: Follow-up Prediction for Brain Tumor Patients
**Course:** _DA5030 - Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Mining_

## Overview
This project builds an ensemble model that combines random forests with homogeneous ensembles of logistic regression, and kNN models to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships in the data. 
The ensemble model is used to predict whether a brain tumor patient requires follow-up treatment based on tumor characteristics and clinical information. 

## Data
The [Brain Tumor Dataset]() from Kaggle was used for this project.
